Olive cake recipe
=================

One of my savoury "cake" recipes from France. This recipe is slightly more substantial than my Chic and Cheerful - Savoury French Olive, Cheese and Onion Cake, as this recipe contains ham with white wine and port! Serve this as alternative sandwich bread or as a light snack spread with cream cheese or butter. This cake recipe will also make fantastic little appetisers if the loaf is cut into small cubes and served with olives, cubes of cheese and savoury spreads. Please note that the texture of this savoury cake is NOT like a sweet dessert cake - it will be slightly holey with a robust and slightly chewy texture, almost like sourdough.
